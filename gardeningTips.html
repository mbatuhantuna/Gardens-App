                <h1>Gardening Tips</h1>
                <p>Want to start digging but don't know where to begin? Use this beginner's guide to gardening for
                    the answers to your gardening questions. Keep reading for all of the basic gardening tips and
                    tricks you'll need to get started.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Light</strong>: Most veggies, especially those that bear fruit (tomatoes, cucumbers,
                        squash, and peppers, for example) need sun, and a lot of it. Ideally, you want a site with
                        at least 8 hours of direct sun per day. In less light, you can still grow some edibles;
                        mainly leafy crops and herbs.</li>

                    <li><strong>Soil</strong>: Healthy, rich soil is the key to a successful and productive
                        vegetable garden, so don’t skip this step! A soil test will give you an idea of your
                        existing soil fertility and pH, and offer suggestions of what types of fertilizers or
                        amendments will get your plot up to par. In my own garden, I rely on homemade compost,
                        organic well-composted animal manures, and organic fertilizers like kelp meal and alfalfa
                        meal.</li>

                    <li><strong>Size</strong>: A vegetable garden can be low-maintenance, but it’s not
                        no-maintenance. Therefore, do yourself a favor and stick to a small plot for the first year
                        or two. A 4 by 8 foot bed is ideal for a starter veggie garden and will give you enough
                        space to grow a handful of crops (see the next point). If you wish to start even smaller,
                        try planting container-friendly veggies and herbs in pots or window-boxes on a sunny deck.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Plants</strong>: With your first veggie garden, it’s very tempting to want to grow
                        everything! But, for your own sake, I’d suggest you pick 4 to 5 types of vegetables and grow
                        them well. Trying to cram too much in a compact space is asking for trouble and you’ll end
                        up with a smaller, not larger harvest. However, you can boost yield by succession planting.
                        When your initial crops have been harvested, follow up with a second sowing. For example,
                        follow spring lettuce with summer beans. Succession planting allows you to stretch your
                        harvest season for the longest possible time.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: Ok, this might be hard to believe, but most bugs are your friends!
                        Think bees, butterflies, <a href="http://savvygardening.com/snapped-good-guy-flies/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">tachinid flies</a>, ladybugs and more! To attract these
                        good guys to your garden – and boost crop pollination – include clumps of insect-friendly
                        plants like sweet alyssum, zinnias, cosmos, and sunflowers between the veggies and herbs.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Water, Weed & Feed</strong>: This might seem to be one of the most obvious vegetable
                        gardening tips, but new veggie gardeners may not know when or how much to water. Newly
                        seeded beds will need frequent watering, but most established crops can get by on one to two
                        inches of water per week. To conserve water and reduce the need to irrigate, mulch your soil
                        with several inches of straw or shredded leaves. Side benefit: the mulch will also suppress
                        weeds! As for feeding, quick-growing crops like radishes and lettuce won’t need supplemental
                        fertilizers if grown in fertile soil. Long-term veggies like tomatoes, winter squash, and
                        eggplants, however, will appreciate a boost several times over the growing season. Give them
                        an occasional dose of a water-soluble organic food to support growth and encourage the
                        biggest harvest.</li>
